## Setup ##

Note there are requirements to run the game!

### Windows (Adapted Version) ###

Download the latest Windows patch as a zip file this will be under patch-# branch<br>
You will find an exe file name "Nullg.exe" <br>
Run the ".exe" file.

### Linux (Adapted Version) ###

Currently I will not be working on a linux patch. <br>
However, It may be a possibility if the game turns out well.

### Linux and Windows (Non adapted) ###

Download The Non-adapted patch from master branch as a zip file <br>
Then simply run startgame.sh (Linux) or startgame.bat (Windows)
